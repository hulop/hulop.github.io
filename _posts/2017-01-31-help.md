NavCog is a navigation app, similar to GPS navigation used by car drivers. This page explainS how to use NavCog. 

## Mode Selection
At application startup, select one of the following 3 modes of use depending on your needs:

* **Visually Impaired Person Mode**:
  * This mode enables non-visual voice navigation by providing precise auditory direction and distance cues to reach user’s destinations. This mode is designed to be used alongside  VoiceOver.

* **Wheelchair User Mode**:
  * This mode provides best wheelchair accessible routes. The application also enables user to reach user’s destination by voice navigation, although the number of voice commands used here is fewer compared to the visually impaired person mode.

* **General Pedestrian Mode**:
  * Besides this mode provides the shortest route to users’ destination, the application works just like in the wheelchair user mode.

There is an option in settings for users to switch among the three options. 


## Interface
The main interface shows the environment map, your position, and the traversed path. 

Additional 3 elements are available:

* **Search** - Search button is on the top-right corner of the interface, which takes you to the destination search screen.

  * Select a destination in the “From” and “To” field right underneath-- either by voice search or select from a list of possible destinations. 
  * User’s recent routes are listed; user may select one of them from the list in the middle of the screen.
  * Route options will allow user to set parameters, like elevators or tactile paving, for the navigation


* **Settings** - Settings button is on top left of the interface. This allows user to change app preferences. In addition to general settings, each navigation mode will have other specific settings
  * Speech speed: Specify the voice speed for both the navigation audio guide and the dialogue assistant.
  * Open Help Page: open this page

* **Voice Search** - On the bottom left of the map screen, tap the microphone icon to start the dialogue assistant and choose your destination by talking to the application. If the application can not determine your current location, the voice search is disabled. Please send feedback if you experience any difficulties.
