## Instructions for Visually Impaired Users

Start navigating with your free hand by holding the phone in front of you. 

Before each instruction, the system will ask for your attention by producing a vibration and short ping sound. Then, you will first hear a high-level description of the route’s destination and length, followed by the first instruction (e.g., go straight and turn left in 30ft). 
 
While you walk, NavCog will periodically tell you the distance and when you are “approaching” the next turning point. Once at the turning point,  the phone will tell you to turn. A turn is generally about 90°, whereas a slight turn is smaller--less than 90°. 

Be careful how far you pivot your body and device; The phone plays a sound and vibrates when you have turned accurately. The system continues to provide next turning point distance and instructions (e.g, turn left at the end of the corridor. There is a door). 

While using the app, it  will also share information regarding the environment. For example: when the floor changes from carpet to marble, and when you have features of interest (e.g., restrooms, water fountains, notable places) or obstacles near you while traversing through the environment. 
 
Use that information for avoiding collisions and as confirmation during navigation. The only possible command is a tap on the screen, which states your current status in case you need confirmation on where you are (for instance, proceed 20 feet and turn right).
 

**NOTE: If silent mode is on, sound effects will not be heard.**
